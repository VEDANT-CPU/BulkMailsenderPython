# Project Description

In today’s real-world Python project, I built a **Bulk Email Sender** — a script that reads email addresses and names from a CSV file and sends personalized emails to each person using Python’s built-in `csv` and `smtplib` modules.

This is incredibly useful in real life — from sending newsletters and promotional updates, to internal announcements or even school-wide messages. No more copy-pasting emails manually!

## Here’s What the App Does:

- Load recipient data from a CSV file like `recipients.csv`, which contains emails and names.
- Compose a personalized message for each contact (e.g., "Hi Alice...").
- Send the email using your Gmail or Outlook account.
- Print a confirmation that each message was sent.

## By Completing This Project, I Learned:

- How to send real emails from Python
- How to personalize those messages using CSV data
- How to use SMTP with `smtplib`
- And how to safely use app passwords for Gmail and Outlook accounts
